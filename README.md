# Forex EUR-USD App
This project is a part of the [Data Science Working Group](http://datascience.codeforsanfrancisco.org) at [Code for San Francisco](http://www.codeforsanfrancisco.org).  Other DSWG projects can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg).

## Project Objectives
This project was a team effort to build and deploy an application analyzing foreign exhange (_"forex"_) rates against the U.S. Dollar, focusing on the Euro (**â‚¬**) to U.S. Dollar (**$**) market. Using Machine Learning, 2018 EUR-USD data, and financial/economic new sentiment analysis, we created and trained varying models to acheive an system that would be capable of trading and profiting in this market. The goal of this model would be to implement a high-frequency trading technique, taking long and short positions over a span of ten minutes. As these trades would occur, their outcomes would be subsquentially logged in the front-end site for users to view how the model can be profitable.

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Project Requirements

- Frontend Deveolment
- ETL Processing
- Machine Learning Modeling
- Advanced Data Analysis

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
